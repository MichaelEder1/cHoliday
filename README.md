# Welcome to cHoliday!

cHoliday is a Single-Page-Application which was created during webdevelopement class at university
It is written in vanilla Javascript and has itÂ´s own Core, Router, Model, Translator and Views.


All data are retrieved from an external API and rendered with help of the render engine. Furthermore the site supports multi-languages and is fully translated in English, German and Spanish with the option to add more languages just by adding the translation-strings. 
Every city and every hotel could be marked as "favourite" by using the Heart-Button next to it. This action will save the id of the marked city or hotel into the localStorage.

The whole page is designed with the help of the TailwindCSS Framework which also allowed me to implement a simple light/darkmode switcher.

## Setup

Just download the files and put them into your localhost directory. Then open the kwm-config.js file in the kwmJS/core directory and adjust the webRoot on line 16 accordingly to your webserver. And that's it :D
